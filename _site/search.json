    "text": "Singapore is home to almost 5.5 million residents as of 2025, and these residents are widely spread across the island.It ranks 129th in the world by population and 32nd in Asia. The population growth rate in 2024 is projected at 0.69 percent, the 129th highest among 237 countries and dependent territories.\n\n\nSource: Singstat\n\nIn this Task, we will be diving into more details on how these residents are distributed across the island. The data that has been used is imported from the SingStat website\n\n\nLet us get started on this Task. But first things first, we need to get some housekeeping done before performing the task, which will be outlined below:\n\n\nIn this step, I will first use the pacman::p_load() function to load up the R packages that will be used to complete the task. The R packages are as follows:\n\nTidyverse: This is the core collection of R packages designed for data science\nggplot2 This is an R package for producing visualizations of data. It uses a conceptual framework based on the grammar of graphics.\nggrepel: This is to provide geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels\nggthemes: to use additional themes for ggplot2\npatchwork: to prepare composite figure created using ggplot2\nggridges: to plot ridgeline plots\nggdist: for visualizations of distributions and uncertainty\nscales: provides the internal scaling infrastructure used by ggplot2\nreadxl: To read all excel files (in xls format)\nlubridate: To read and handle dates\nJanitor: To clean up column names and data formatting purposes\n\n\nlibrary(\"pacman\")\nsuppressWarnings(library(\"lubridate\"))\nlibrary(readr)\n\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, readxl, \n               janitor, lubridate, \n               ggplot2, ggthemes, \n               scales, ggridges, \n               ggdist, patchwork)\n\n\n\n\nIn this step, we will now be importing the dataset that we have obtained earlier from the SingStat website, and the code is as follows:\n\nResident_Data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Resident_Data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nAfter importing the dataset, I will be using the glimpse function to determine any similar rows that can be found inside this dataset\n\nglimpse(Resident_Data)\n\nRows: 75,696\nColumns: 7\n$ PA      &lt;chr&gt; \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang M…\n$ Subzone &lt;chr&gt; \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\", \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\", \"Ang Mo Ki…\n$ AG      &lt;chr&gt; \"0_to_4\", \"0_to_4\", \"0_to_4\", \"0_to_4\", \"0_to_4\", \"0_to_4\", \"0…\n$ Sex     &lt;chr&gt; \"Males\", \"Males\", \"Males\", \"Males\", \"Males\", \"Males\", \"Females…\n$ FA      &lt;chr&gt; \"&lt;= 60\", \"&gt;60 to 80\", \"&gt;80 to 100\", \"&gt;100 to 120\", \"&gt;120\", \"No…\n$ Pop     &lt;int&gt; 0, 10, 10, 50, 10, 0, 0, 0, 20, 30, 10, 0, 0, 10, 30, 70, 20, …\n$ Year    &lt;int&gt; 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 20…\n\n\nNext, we also need to ensure that there are no duplicates in the data, so the duplicate function is used, as shown below:\n\nResident_Data[duplicated(Resident_Data),]\n\n[1] PA      Subzone AG      Sex     FA      Pop     Year   \n&lt;0 rows&gt; (or 0-length row.names)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Analyse the data provided at the csv file taken from the SingStat website, we will be anaysing how the residents of Singapore are scattered based on Area (Planing Area), Functional Age (FA), and sex.\n\n\nOne of the ways that I used to visualise the dataset is using the bar chart based on the ppulation area. Here, we can see which of the residential areas are the most popular for Singaore residents. Bar charts provide a straightforward way to compare population sizes across different planning areas (PA), and are simple and widely understood by most audiences, regardless of their experience with data visualization. The length of the bars makes it easy to spot the highest and lowest population areas at a glance.\n\nPlotCodes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfiltered_data &lt;- Resident_Data[!is.na(Resident_Data$Pop) & Resident_Data$Pop &gt; 0, ]\n\nggplot(data = filtered_data, aes(x = reorder(`PA`, Pop), y = Pop)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population by Planning Area (Singapore, 2024)\",\n    x = \"Planning Area\",\n    y = \"Population\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 20) +  # Increase base font size\n  \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.margin = margin(1, 1, 1, 1, \"cm\")  # Add breathing space\n  )\n\n\n\n\nFrom the visualisation above, we can easily determine that most residents prefers to live around Tampines and Pasir Ris towns, given the proximity to other major transport nodes such as Changi Airport and the direct train connections to the city centre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary: What can we learn from this visualization?\n\n\n\n\nBar charts provides a simple and straightforward visualization method for analysts\nThe length of bars can easily help us to visualize on what is the most affected variable\nThis data visualization shows that most residents prefer to live in towns such as Tampines and Pasir Ris\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother visualisation that I made from this dataset is the pyramid bar chart. The pyramid bar chart aims to visualise the number of residential population based on gender and age groups. This technique helps us for enhanced Comparisons between two Categories, eg. based on gender and age group.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npyramid_data &lt;- aggregate(Pop ~ `AG` + Sex, data = Resident_Data, sum)\n\nage_order &lt;- c(\"0_to_4\", \"5_to_9\", \"10_to_14\", \"15_to_19\", \"20_to_24\", \"25_to_29\", \n               \"30_to_34\", \"35_to_39\", \"40_to_44\", \"45_to_49\", \"50_to_54\", \"55_to_59\", \n               \"60_to_64\", \"65_to_69\", \"70_to_74\", \"75_to_79\", \"80_to_84\", \"85_to_89\", \n               \"90_and_over\")\n\npyramid_data$AG &lt;- factor(pyramid_data$AG, levels = age_order)\n\npyramid_data$Pop[pyramid_data$Sex == \"Males\"] &lt;- -pyramid_data$Pop[pyramid_data$Sex == \"Males\"]\n\nggplot(data = pyramid_data, aes(x = AG, y = Pop, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Population Pyramid (2024)\", x = \"Age Group\", y = \"Population\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"skyblue\", \"salmon\")) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10))  \n\n\n\n\nFrom this visualisation, we can easily determine that most residents are still within the working age of 30 to 34 years old. However, given that Singapore is projected to have an increase in aging population by 2050 (Siau, 2019), the pyramind graph also shows that there is a high number of population wwithin the age groups of 35 to 65.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we learn from this visualization?\n\n\n\n\nThe visualization technique on using the pyramid graph can be used to visualize a bar graph by using 2 different categories\nThis visualization technique is beneficial especially When the population of different planning areas is split into categories and you want to see the relative size of those categories.\nThis visualization technique shows that most residents in Singapore fall within the age groups of 30 to 65 for both genders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother visualization technique I used is the box plot technique. Box plots are used to visually display the distribution and variability of data, and in this case, I will use it to compare population distributions across different functional age bands (FA Bands).\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFA_order &lt;- c(\"&lt;= 60\", \"&gt;60 to 80\", \"&gt;80 to 100\", \"&gt;100 to 120\", \"&gt;120\", \"Not Available\")\nResident_Data$FA &lt;- factor(Resident_Data$FA, levels = FA_order)\n\nggplot(Resident_Data, aes(x = FA, y = Pop)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightgreen\") +\n  labs(title = \"Population by Functional Age Range (FA)\", x = \"FA Band\", y = \"Population\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nFrom the above visualization, we can infer that the population in the &gt;100 to 120 FA Band has a larger spread and higher population values than the &lt;=60 FA Band. For the &gt;100 to 120 band, There is a large spread of population values, indicating higher variability in population within this FA Band. The median line is placed higher in the box, showing that the central tendency is also higher in this age band. There are also presence of outliers in some bands indicates that there are extreme values in the population data for certain age groups, suggesting that these age ranges have a more diverse or skewed distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can we learn from this visualization?\n\n\n\n\nBox plots are generally used to visually display the distribution and variability of data\nThe presence of Outliers indicates that there are extreme values in the population data for certain age groups\nBox plot visualisation helps analysts to Compare distributions across different categories\nThis technique also helps to identify and analyze variations, spread, and central tendency within the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three visualization techniques can help us to better understand and study the contents of the data set provided by singstat. Having these visualization techniques can help us to better understand how Resident data is spread out across Singapore in various ways.\nTherefore, we can conclude that these visualisation techniques can be used to examine this dataset, which are the following:\n\nUsing Bar chart based on Population Area: This technique provides a straightforward way to compare population sizes across different variables, and are simple and widely understood by most audiences, regardless of their experience with data visualization.\nUsing Pyramid Bar chart based on Population Area: The visualization technique on using the pyramid graph can be used to visualize a bar graph by using 2 different categories at the same time\nUsing Box Plot based on Age Range: This visualization technique are mainly used to visually display the distribution and variability of data\n\n\n\n\nSiau, M.

    "text": "Through this hands-on Exercise, I will learn how to create interactive data visualisation by using functions provided by ggiraph and plotlyr packages.\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages:\n\nggiraph for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\nDT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\npatchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to accomplish the task.\n\npacman::p_load(plotly,patchwork, DT, tidyverse) \nlibrary(ggiraph)\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, Exam_data.csv provided will be used. Using read_csv() of readr package, import Exam_data.csv into R.\nThe code chunk below read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv data file into R and save it as an tibble data frame called exam_data.\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nggiraph  is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\nlibrary(ggiraph)\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e.geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then,girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\n\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\n\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.\n\n\n\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css &lt;- \"background-color:white; #&lt;&lt;\nfont-style:bold; color:black;\" #&lt;&lt;\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(    #&lt;&lt;\n    opts_tooltip(    #&lt;&lt;\n      css = tooltip_css)) #&lt;&lt;\n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the background colour of the tooltip is black and the font colour is white and bold.\n\n\nRefer to Customizing girafe objects to learn more about how to customise ggiraph objects.\n\n\n\n\nCode chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean.

Different from other plotly platform, plot.R is free and open source.\n\nThere are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly, they are:\n\nby using plot_ly(), and\nby using ggplotly()\n\n\n\nThe tabset below shows an example a basic interactive plot created by using plot_ly().\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n             x = ~MATHS, \n             y = ~ENGLISH)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, color argument is mapped to a qualitative visual variable (i.e. RACE).\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~ENGLISH, \n        y = ~MATHS, \n        color = ~RACE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots an interactive scatter plot by using ggplotly().\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nggplotly(p)\n\nNotice that the only extra line you need to include in the code chunk is ggplotly().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe creation of a coordinated linked plot by using plotly involves three steps:\n\nhighlight_key() of plotly package is used as shared data.\ntwo scatterplots will be created by using ggplot2 functions.\nlastly, subplot() of plotly package is used to place them next to each other side-by-side.\n\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nsubplot(ggplotly(p1),\n        ggplotly(p2))\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight_key() simply creates an object of class crosstalk::SharedData.\nVisit this link to learn more about crosstalk,\n\n\n\n\n\nCrosstalk is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).\n\n\n\nA wrapper of the JavaScript Library DataTables\nData objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the JavaScript library ‘DataTables’ (typically via R Markdown or Shiny).\n\n\nDT::datatable(exam_data, class= \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data) \np &lt;- ggplot(d, \n            aes(ENGLISH, \n                MATHS)) + \n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\ngg &lt;- highlight(ggplotly(p),        \n                \"plotly_selected\")  \n\ncrosstalk::bscols(gg,               \n                  DT::datatable(d), \n                  widths = 5)        \n\nThings to learn from the code chunk:\n\nhighlight() is a function of plotly package. It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.

At the same time, I have also gained hands-on experience on using these components to plot statistical graphics based on the principle of Layered Grammar of Graphics. By the end of this chapter I will be able to apply the essential graphical elements provided by ggplot2 to create elegant and yet functional statistical graphics.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore getting started on the hands-on exercises, it is very important for me to first ensure that the required R packages have been installed. If yes, we will load the R packages. If they have yet to be installed, we will install the R packages and load them onto R environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below assumes that you already have pacman package installed. If not, please go ahead install pacman first.\n\n\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below imports Exam_data.csv into R environment by using read_csv() function of readr package.\nreadr is one of the tidyverse package.\n\n\nExam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\nYear end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school.\nThere are a total of seven attributes.

It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\nSo what is a statistical graphic?\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978).

Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\nThe code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Statistics functions statistically transform data, usually as some form of summary. For example:\n\nfrequency of values of a variable (bar graph)\n\na mean\na confidence limit\n\nThere are two ways to use these functions:\n\nadd a stat_() function and override the default geom, or\nadd a geom_() function and override the default stat.\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplots below are incomplete because the positions of the means were not shown.\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adds mean values by using stat_summary() function and overriding the default geom.\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun.y=\"mean\",         \n               colour =\"red\",        \n               size=4) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adding mean values by using geom_() function and overriding the default stat.\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_point(stat=\"summary\",        \n             fun.y=\"mean\",           \n             colour =\"red\",          \n             size=4)          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot below shows the relationship of Maths and English grades of pupils. The interpretability of this graph can be improved by adding a best fit curve.\n\nIn the code chunk below,geom_smooth() is used to plot a best fit curve on the scatterplot.\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(size=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe default method used is loess.\n\n\n\nThe default smoothing method can be overridden as shown below.\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacetting generates small multiples (sometimes also called trellis plot), each displaying a different subset of the data. They are an alternative to aesthetics for displaying additional discrete variables. ggplot2 supports two types of factes, namely: facet_grid() and facet_wrap.\n\n\nfacet_wrap wraps a 1d sequence of panels into 2d. This is generally a better use of screen space than facet_grid because most displays are roughly rectangular.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet-wrap().\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacet_grid() forms a matrix of panels defined by row and column facetting variables. It is most useful when you have two discrete variables, and all combinations of the variables exist in the data.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet_grid().\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_grid(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coordinates functions map the position of objects onto the plane of the plot. There are a number of different possible coordinate systems to use, they are:\n\ncoord_cartesian(): the default cartesian coordinate systems, where you specify x and y values (e.g. allows you to zoom in or out).\ncoord_flip(): a cartesian system with the x and y flipped.\ncoord_fixed(): a cartesian system with a “fixed” aspect ratio (e.g. 1.78 for a “widescreen” plot).\ncoord_quickmap(): a coordinate system that approximates a good aspect ratio for maps.\n\n\n\nBy the default, the bar chart of ggplot2 is in vertical form.\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below flips the horizontal bar chart into vertical bar chart by using coord_flip().\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot on the right is slightly misleading because the y-aixs and x-axis range are not equal.\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below fixed both the y-axis and x-axis range from 0-100.\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes control elements of the graph not related to the data. For example:\n\nbackground colour\nsize of fonts\ngridlines\ncolour of labels\n\nBuilt-in themes include: - theme_gray() (default) - theme_bw() - theme_classic()\nA list of theme can be found at this link. Each theme element can be conceived of as either a line (e.g. x-axis), a rectangle (e.g. graph background), or text (e.g. axis title).\n\n\nThe code chunk below plot a horizontal bar chart using theme_gray().\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_gray()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_classic().\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_minimal().\n\nggplot(data=Exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHadley Wickham (2023) ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.

It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\nSo what is a statistical graphic?\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics. Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background."

There are several ggplot2 extensions provide functions to compose figure with multiple graphs. In this section, you will learn how to create composite plot by combining multiple graphs. First, let us create three statistical graphics by using the code chunk below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=Exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\")\n\n\n\n\nNext\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=Exam_data, \n             aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of English scores\")\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we will draw a scatterplot for English score versus Maths score by as shown below\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(data=Exam_data, \n             aes(x= MATHS, \n                 y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ggplot2 extension’s functions support the needs to prepare composite figure by combining several graphs such as grid.arrange() of gridExtra package and plot_grid() of cowplot package. In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily.

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\ngapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its country_colors scheme.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\n\n\npacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder,\n               plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.\nWrite a code chunk to import Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook by using appropriate R package from tidyverse family.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\nread_xls() of readxl package is used to import the Excel worksheet.\nmutate_each_() of dplyr package is used to convert all character data type into factor.\nmutate of dplyr package is used to convert data values of Year field into integer.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, mutate_each_() was deprecated in dplyr 0.7.0. and funs() was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0. In view of this, we will re-write the code by using mutate_at() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(col, as.factor) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\nInstead of using mutate_at(), across() can be used to derive the same outputs.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(col, as.factor)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\n\n\ngganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below,\n\ntransition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).\nease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe animated bubble chart\n\n\n\n\nIn Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic. They also support an ids argument/aesthetic to ensure smooth transitions between objects with the same id (which helps facilitate object constancy).\n\n\nIn this sub-section, you will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using ggplotly() method.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\nThe animated bubble plot above includes a play/pause button and a slider component for controlling the animation\n\n\n\nNotice that although show.legend = FALSE argument was used, the legend still appears on the plot. To overcome this problem, theme(legend.position='none') should be used as shown in the plot and code chunk below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') + \n  theme(legend.position='none')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this sub-section, you will learn how to create an animated bubble plot by using plot_ly() method.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbp &lt;- globalPop %&gt;%\n  plot_ly(x = ~Old, \n          y = ~Young, \n          size = ~Population, \n          color = ~Continent,\n          sizes = c(2, 100),\n          frame = ~Year, \n          text = ~Country, \n          hoverinfo = \"text\",\n          type = 'scatter',\n          mode = 'markers'\n          ) %&gt;%\n  layout(showlegend = FALSE)\nbp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nVisit this link for a very interesting implementation of gganimate by your senior.\nBuilding an animation step-by-step with gganimate.\nCreating a composite gif with multiple gganimate panels"

At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts."

    "text": "Visualising distribution is not new in statistical analysis. In chapter 1 we have shared with you some of the popular statistical graphics methods for visualising distribution are histogram, probability density curve (pdf), boxplot, notch plot and violin plot and how they can be created by using ggplot2. In this chapter, we are going to share with you two relatively new statistical graphic methods for visualising distribution, namely ridgeline plot and raincloud plot by using ggplot2 and its extensions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages will be used, they are:\n\nggridges: A ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots,\nggdist: A ggplot2 extension spacially desgin for visualising distribution and uncertainty,\ntidyverse: A family of R packages to meet the modern data science and visual communication needs,\nggthemes: A ggplot extension that provides the user additional themes, scales, and geoms for the ggplots package\ncolorspace: An R package provides a broad toolbox for selecting individual colors or color palettes, manipulating these colors, and employing them in various kinds of visualisations.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used load these R packages into RStudio environment.\n\npacman::p_load(ggdist, ggridges, ggthemes,\n               colorspace, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, Exam_data.csv will be used.\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv into R and saved it into a tibble data.frame.\n\nexam &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nThe figure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n:::call-out note Ridgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better. :::\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing additional geom objects to support the need to plot ridgeline plot, ggridges package also provides a stat function called stat_density_ridges() that replaces stat_density() of ggplot2.\nFigure below is plotted by mapping the probabilities calculated by using stat(ecdf) which represent the empirical cumulative density function for the distribution of English score.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: call-out Important It is important include the argument calc_ecdf = TRUE in stat_density_ridges(). :::\n\n\n\nBy using geom_density_ridges_gradient(), we can colour the ridgeline plot by quantile, via the calculated stat(quantile) aesthetic as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using number to define the quantiles, we can also specify quantiles by cut points such as 2.5% and 97.5% tails to colour the ridgeline plot as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::call-out note We remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA. :::\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Ridgeline Plots (formerly Joyplots) Claus O.

If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better. :::\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight."

    "text": "There are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing additional geom objects to support the need to plot ridgeline plot, ggridges package also provides a stat function called stat_density_ridges() that replaces stat_density() of ggplot2.\nFigure below is plotted by mapping the probabilities calculated by using stat(ecdf) which represent the empirical cumulative density function for the distribution of English score.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: call-out Important It is important include the argument calc_ecdf = TRUE in stat_density_ridges(). :::\n\n\n\nBy using geom_density_ridges_gradient(), we can colour the ridgeline plot by quantile, via the calculated stat(quantile) aesthetic as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using number to define the quantiles, we can also specify quantiles by cut points such as 2.5% and 97.5% tails to colour the ridgeline plot as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk"

    "text": "Raincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::call-out note We remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA. :::\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk"
